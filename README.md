# design-patterns-examples-java
Case studies of each of each of the 23 Gang-of-Four design patterns implemented in Java.

Each case study is a condensed example of how to use each design pattern and is not meant to be a full implementation of the context of each of the case studies.  

The focus here is not to show the reader how to implement the context of each case study.  Rather, the focus is on how one could design specific features within the context using design patterns.

Design patterns facilitate discussion about software design since they boil down many commonly encountered situations that software developers run into into a set of 23 common scenarios.

Please view the JUnit test cases in the "test" directory for an explanation of the context of each example.
