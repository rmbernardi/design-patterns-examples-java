# Design Patterns Examples, In Java
This repository contains case studies of each of the twenty-three Gang-of-Four (GoF) design patterns, implemented in Java.  The contexts of the case studies were created from typical scenarios that can be encountered in many of the commercially available fantasy, role-playing games.  

The examples are intended to be a tutorial for software developers that would like to become more familiar with design patterns.  Though the examples here are presented in Java, the concepts are language-independent and can be implemented in other object-oriented languages such as C# or C++.

Each case study is a condensed example of how to use each design pattern and is not meant to be a full implementation of the context of each of the case studies.  

The intention here is not to show the reader how to implement the full story behind the context of each case study.  Rather, the focus is on how one could design very specific features using design patterns to make code that is adaptable to change.

Design patterns facilitate discussion about software design since they boil down many commonly encountered situations that software developers run into into a set of 23 common scenarios.  Additionally, following the GoF guidelines can help to create code that is more adaptable to change.

Please view the JUnit test cases in the "test" directory for an explanation of the context of each example.
